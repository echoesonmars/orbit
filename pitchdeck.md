ORBITAI PITCH DECK - DATA-DRIVEN SPECIFICATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SLIDE 1: VISION
OrbitAI: The Cognitive OS for a $1.3T Space Economy. 
Securing LEO through deterministic math and AI reasoning.

SLIDE 2: THE PAIN (THE NUMBERS OF FAILURE)
- $500B: Value at risk due to orbital debris and collision events.
- 20%: Failure rate of SmallSat missions within first 12 months.
- $100k+: Daily loss for a telecom satellite during "Operational Blindness" (unplanned downtime).
- 400%: Increase in orbital congestion since 2020.
- 0: Number of legacy tools that unify ROI, Physics, and ESG.

SLIDE 3: SUSTAINABILITY PAIN
- 25 Years: The UN/IADC deorbit limit being violated by 35% of current LEO assets.
- $50/ton: Rising cost of carbon offsets that operators fail to calculate accurately.
- Legal Risk: New FCC 5-year deorbit rules create $1M+ liability for non-compliant operators.

SLIDE 4: SOLUTION (ORBITAI METRICS)
- 95% reduction in mission planning time (Months to Minutes).
- 48-72 hours: Lead time provided by our ML Anomaly Detection before subsystem failure.
- 10,000 simulations: Monte Carlo depth for every financial ROI forecast.
- A+ to F: Instant, verifiable ESG grading for institutional investors.

SLIDE 5: MARKET (TAM/SAM/SOM)
- TAM: $1.3 Trillion (Total Space Economy 2030).
- SAM: $30 Billion (Mission Ops & Data Intelligence).
- SOM: $2.5 Billion (Commercial SmallSat sector).
- Growth: 10x increase in active satellites projected vs 2024.

SLIDE 6: COMPETITIVE EDGE (THE GAP)
- AGI/STK: $50,000/seat | 0 AI | Desktop-bound legacy code.
- LeoLabs: Debris only | No ROI | No ESG.
- OrbitAI: $1,000/mo | Full AI | Cloud-Native | ROI + Physics + ESG.

SLIDE 7: FAILURE FORENSICS (PAIN RELIEF)
- Problem: Satellites die "silently."
- Tech: Isolation Forest ML on high-frequency telemetry.
- Result: Identifies 0.03% contamination in sensor data (Sub-threshold drifts).
- Value: Prevents loss of $10M-$50M assets through proactive deorbit or repair.

SLIDE 8: SCENARIO SIMULATOR (THE MATH)
- Method: Monte Carlo (10,000 iterations).
- Variables: Launch failure, annual degradation, solar cycle variance, revenue growth.
- Output: P10/P50/P90 ROI percentiles. 
- Goal: Stop operators from "guessing" their profitability.

SLIDE 9: BUSINESS MODEL (RECURRING REVENUE)
- Startup: $1k/mo (1 user, basic scoring).
- Operator: $10k/mo (ML Forensics, ESG certification).
- Enterprise: $50k+/mo (Megaconstellation API, Whitelabel reports).
- LTV/CAC: Projecting 5:1 ratio due to vertical integration.

SLIDE 10: TECHNOLOGY STACK - THE CORE (RELIABILITY & COMPUTE)
The OrbitAI architecture is designed for "High-Performance Aerospace Simulation" (HPAS).

BACKEND (COMPUTE & LOGIC)
- Language: Python 3.11/3.13 (Heavy math & ML).
- Framework: FastAPI (Asynchronous high-throughput API).
- Server: Uvicorn (UV loop for extreme performance).
- ML Libraries: Scikit-learn (Isolation Forest), Pandas (Telemetry processing), NumPy (Vectorized Monte Carlo).
- AI: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (Autonomous mission reasoning & root-cause analysis).
- Reporting: ReportLab (Binary PDF generation), Matplotlib (Deterministic plotting).

ORCHESTRATION & GATEWAY
- Language: TypeScript / Node.js.
- Framework: Express.js (Request routing & middleware).
- Validation: Zod (Schema-first validation for all payload types).
- Client: Axios (Service-to-service communication).
- Uploads: Multer / Form-data (Binary CSV stream processing).

FRONTEND (COMMAND CENTER UI)
- Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router, Server Components).
- UI: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI (High-contrast glassmorphism).
- Graphics: Custom Canvas API (Performance-heavy Fan Charts & Histograms).
- Icons: Lucide React.
- State: React Hooks + Context API.

DATABASE & INFRASTRUCTURE
- Engine: PostgreSQL (hosted via Supabase).
- Logic: Row Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenant data isolation.
- Auth: Supabase Auth (JWT based).
- Storage: Supabase Storage (Telemetry storage).
- Deploy: Docker + Railway (Scale-to-zero containerization).

SLIDE 11: THE ESG FLYWHEEL
- OrbitAI creates the "Carbon Score" for Space.
- As more constellations are scored, our "Sustainable Orbit Index" becomes the mandatory benchmark for Space Insurance.

SLIDE 12: ROADMAP 2026
- Q1: Alpha Deploy (Current: 10 Modules live).
- Q2: Real-time NOAA/TLE integration.
- Q3: AI Autopilot for deorbit maneuvers.
