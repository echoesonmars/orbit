# ORBITAI PITCH DECK

## SLIDE 1: VISION
**OrbitAI** is the decision-intelligence layer for a **$1.3T** space economy.
The only AI-native operating system that unifies orbital physics, mission economics, and ESG compliance.

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM (RISK & REGULATION)
* **$500B at Risk:** Orbital debris and collision events threaten existing infrastructure.
* **20% Failure Rate:** SmallSat missions fail within the first 12 months.
* **$1M+ Liability:** New strict FCC 5-year deorbit rules penalize non-compliant spacecraft.
* **The Gap:** Legacy systems cannot calculate Physics, Financial ROI, and ESG in a single stack.

## SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION (COMMAND CENTER)
* **All-in-One Engine:** Interactive map linking orbital changes directly to Capex/Opex and ESG impact.
* **Failure Forensics (ML):** Early warning system detecting subsystem anomalies before they become critical.
* **Instant Output:** Generates investor-grade PDF reports, translating raw telemetry into financial language.

## SLIDE 4: THE IMPACT (WHY IT MATTERS)
* **Speed:** 95% reduction in mission planning time (from months to minutes).
* **Safety:** **72h** lead time for failure prevention, saving $10M–$50M assets.
* **Precision:** **10,000+** Monte Carlo simulations to guarantee P10/P50/P90 ROI forecasts.
* **Compliance:** Instant A+ to F ESG grading for insurers.

## SLIDE 5: THE MARKET 
* **TAM:** $1.3 Trillion (Space Economy by 2030).
* **SAM:** $30 Billion (Mission Ops & Data Intelligence).
* **SOM:** $2.5 Billion (Commercial SmallSat Operators).
* **Driver:** 10x increase in active satellites. Every new asset needs ROI and ESG validation.

**The most efficient path to building multi-model, database-backed AI applications.**

| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model Choice & Ecosystem** | ✅ **Native Multi-Model Integration** <br> (Access to Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and custom GPT-OSS models in one place) | ❌ **Single Vendor Only** <br> (Restricted to OpenAI models only: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, etc.) | ❌ **Fragmented & Complex** <br> (Must manage and configure separate adapters for each model provider) |
| **Database Integration** | ✅ **Seamless Supabase dedicated Postgres Instance** <br> (Built-in data layer for AI applications, including Data API and Row Level Security options) | ❌ **None** <br> (No native database integration)                      | ❌ **None** <br> (You are responsible for setting up and managing your own database connections) |
| **Quota & Usage Monitoring** | ✅ **Unified Quota Dashboard with Real-Time Refresh Timers** <br> (One dashboard to track limits for all integrated models, with accurate per-model countdowns) | ❌ **Fragmented & OpenAI-Only** <br> (Must use a single-vendor console; cannot view other model provider quotas) | ❌ **Rely on External Quotas** <br> (Usage is tied to external provider & function quotas; no single view) |
| **Deployment Platform** | ✅ **Fully Managed Platform Experience** <br> (Includes Vercel-managed frontend, Supabase-managed database, and integrated dashboard) | ❌ **API-Only** <br> (You must build, deploy, and manage all infrastructure to use the API) | ❌ **SDK-Only** <br> (You must manage the entire application stack outside of the AI SDK) |
| **Data Residency** | ✅ **Asia-Pacific Supabase Region Option** <br> (Ability to choose region closest to users, like Asia-Pacific for Supabase database) | ❌ **None** <br> (Limited data residency choices; typically US-centric) | ❌ **Varies by Model Provider** <br> (Data residency depends on each individual model provider's setup) |
